This project was completed for the Fundamentals course under The Odin Project. The purpose of the project was to use DOM manipulation tools in Javascript to create an interactive Etch-A-Sketch web app. The idea is to create cell <divs> within a <container> only using Javascipt and then manipulating the cells with event listeners. 

HOW IT WORKS:

The user is prompted to enter a number (n) from 1 to 100. An (n x n) grid is then created based on the user input. The grid can then be manipulated (cells change color) as the user mouses over each of the cells. A clear button is provided to reset the grid. 

Additional features to be added:
- Grid size slider instead of user prompt
- Randomize cell color instead of just black (*ADDED*)
